# Enhanced Comprehensive Acely Scraper Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the enhanced scraper that captures ALL metrics and uploads everything to Supabase.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Process

### 1. Update Your Supabase Database Schema

First, run the SQL script to add the new columns to your existing `acely_students` table:

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
cat alter_acely_students_table.sql
```

Or copy the contents of `alter_acely_students_table.sql` and paste into your Supabase SQL Editor.

### 2. Run the Enhanced Scraper

```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the comprehensive enhanced scraper
python3 acely_scraper_enhanced.py
```

## 🔧 What's New in the Enhanced Version

### Enhanced Database Schema
- **`total_students_requested`** - Total students in scraping session
- **`students_found`** - Students successfully located
- **`students_scraped`** - Students with data extracted
- **`scrape_errors`** - Array of errors encountered
- **`scrape_summary`** - Summary statistics
- **`subject`** - Identified test type (SAT/ACT)
- **`charts_data`** - Chart and visualization data
- **`extraction_metadata`** - Metadata about extraction process
- **`activity_summary`** - Calculated activity summaries
- **`performance_summary`** - Calculated performance summaries

### Comprehensive Data Capture
The enhanced scraper captures everything from `acely_scraper.py`:
- ✅ **Complete Mock Exam Results** (6 exams with scores)
- ✅ **Detailed Daily Activity** (tooltip data with question counts)
- ✅ **Performance by Topic** (Math, Reading, Writing percentages)
- ✅ **Strongest/Weakest Areas** (specific skills analysis)
- ✅ **Weekly Performance Trends** (time-based data)
- ✅ **Raw Page Sections** (complete text extraction)

### Smart Email Management
- Loads students from both `student_emails.txt` AND existing Supabase records
- Combines and deduplicates email lists automatically
- Falls back gracefully if Supabase is unavailable

## 📊 New Database Views and Queries

### Student Performance Summary View
```sql
SELECT * FROM student_performance_summary 
ORDER BY most_recent_score DESC;
```

### Query Examples for Enhanced Data
```sql
-- Students with high activity
SELECT student_name, 
       (activity_summary->>'total_active_days')::int AS active_days,
       (activity_summary->>'total_questions_attempted')::int AS questions
FROM acely_students 
WHERE (activity_summary->>'total_active_days')::int > 5;

-- Math performance analysis
SELECT student_name, 
       (performance_summary->>'math_avg_score')::numeric AS math_avg,
       jsonb_array_length(mock_exam_results) AS total_exams
FROM acely_students 
WHERE (performance_summary->>'math_avg_score')::numeric > 80;

-- Recent scraping sessions
SELECT scrape_timestamp, 
       students_scraped, 
       (scrape_summary->>'success_rate') AS success_rate
FROM acely_students 
GROUP BY scrape_timestamp, students_scraped, scrape_summary
ORDER BY scrape_timestamp DESC;
```

## 🔍 Data Quality and Completeness

The enhanced scraper calculates a **Data Richness Score** (0-100%) based on:
- **Basic Profile Data** (20 points): Name, score, join date, weekly questions
- **Performance Data** (30 points): Topic performance, strongest/weakest areas
- **Activity Data** (30 points): Daily activity calendars, practice sessions
- **Mock Exam Data** (20 points): Exam results and scores

## 🛠️ Configuration Options

All the same environment variables work, plus:
```env
# Existing variables
ACELY_EMAIL=your_gmail@gmail.com
ACELY_PASSWORD=your_google_password
HEADLESS_MODE=True
WAIT_TIMEOUT=10
